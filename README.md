## Project Overview

This project presents the design and development of a role-based Digital Gate Pass System that automates hostel movement tracking. The system follows a multi-level approval workflow (Student → Mentor → Warden → Security → Admin) and generates QR codes for secure entry and exit validation.

The project emphasizes the application of Software Engineering principles including:

- Requirement Engineering  
- Modular System Architecture  
- Agile-based Incremental Development  
- Version Control using GitHub  
- Database Schema Design  
- Testing and Validation  

The system ensures transparency, security, and real-time tracking of student movement while demonstrating structured software development practices.
